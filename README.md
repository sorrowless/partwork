Partwork is small utility to autoartwork mp3 files.

It can be used from command line to artwork your mp3's.
To start using, just run in console:

$ python partwork.py -f <path to file>

to artwork that file, or

$ python partwork.py -d <path to directory>

to artwork files in that directory, or

$ python partwork.py -r -d <path to directory>

to artwork files in that directory recursively.

Partwork will trying to search artwork for your files in local directory
or in case of fail in LastFM (for what we need to use lastfm key which you
can get absolutely free).
